          <h1>So <span>who</span> is this guy?</h1>
          <p>" Even in literature and art, no man who bothers about originality will ever be original: whereas if you simply try to tell the truth (without caring twopence how often it has been told before) you will, nine times out of ten, become original without ever having noticed it. "</p>

          <h2>Who I am</h2>
          <p>Hi, I'm Mark and I'm a Designer and Web developer. </br>
            I started out my career doing a very simple landing page for my friend but really quickly fell in love with the web. Now I have a whole team of developers and designers who help me to create awesome solutions for your business. I love my job and even can’t imagine the life without Web Development. That’s what I enjoy and can't get enough of it. I use this passion to create things that solve problems. </br>
            When I'm not coding and creating useful solutions, you'll find me cooking, eating, exercising in the park and riding a longboard on lonely roads.</p>

              <h3>I understand the challenges of working remotely. Here’s a couple of things I’m good at.</h3> <br>
            </article>



            <article>
              <h4>Organisation</h4>
              <p>I believe it’s important to stay organised while working remotely. I use the likes of Trello & Basecamp to help keep projects on-track and under control.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h4>Time Keeping</h4>
              <p>I value my clients’ time and always aim to work efficiently. I account for and track everything I do using services such as Toggl.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h4>Project Management</h4>
              <p>I think it’s important to identify the discrete stages of a project and work to a schedule around those.</p>
            </article>


            <article>
              <h4>Development</h4>
              <p>I recognize the importance of applying proper software development techniques to the web.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h4>Documentation</h4>
              <p>Often overlooked, I think it's incredibly important to leave clients with a clear picture of what's been done for the next round of development.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h4>Communication</h4>
              <p>I realize the importance of good communication. I use tools like Slack to make sure we’re always on the same page.</p>
